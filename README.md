# ESPPRC
Java implementation of an algorithm solving an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints.
A mathematical model was implemented and solved by CPLEX to compare results with the implementation.
The algorithm corresponds to the one proposed in the paper written by D. Feillet (2004)[1].
